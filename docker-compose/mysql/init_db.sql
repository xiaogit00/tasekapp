He\'s a production technician with Becton Dickinson & Co, a medical company and has been there for 19 months (3x 3-month contracts and 10 month permanent). With OT, he earns around $1500. His previous work experience was mainly in logistics, warehouse operations and had gotten his forklift license along the way.His NT exams results were not good because he had pending cases involving mischief and assault, and was sent to Singapore Boys\' Home and then to Singapore Boys\' Hostel, losing 3 months of schooling and preparation for his national exams. Despite that he had 3 passes and was able to get into a mechatronics course in ITE. Within a month he quit the course due to the bad company he kept. He expressed regret for that opportunity lost.Haymaraj would like to go back to get his Nitec and more if possible. He leans towards logistics/ supply chain related courses because of prior experience. A work & study program is ideal as he needs to support his grandmother and an impaired uncle. He did inquire if there are full-time work & study programs and I said I\'ll channel that question to you, Dr Kripesh. I have the impression that he is driven to pursue his studies - he had planned to work the rest of this year to save and finance his ITE course prior to approaching MPS for help. On this note, he is happy to work in a suitable sponsoring company before being enrolled later this Dec/Jan.Haymaraj\'s grandmother has multiple ailments and is seen in KTPH. She is happy to make her way there, though inconvenient, because she has a regular doctor there who is kindly and trusted. The grandmother visits her dementia-stricken father (H\'s great grandfather) in a elderly home somewhere in Hillview about 2-3 times a week. She visits regularly as she felt her father may not have that much time left (according to H). Due to her poor eyesight and mobility, she uses taxi or Grab which costs quite a bit.Haymaraj\'s uncle had gotten more medical subsidies 4-5 months ago when the grandmother made the necessary applications. However, due to his medical condition, he lacks arm/hand strength so there may be no viable work options. The uncle had never worked as the grandmother was very protective, and Haymaraj thinks he will continue to not work, and that he will have to eventually be the uncle\'s sole care-giver. It doesn\'t seem like there are other family members who can help support the grandmother and uncle. I found out from an Education & Career Guidance counsellor that NITEC Traineeship (work & study) programs are part-time but the course duration is the same as regular programs; due to shortened classroom sessions and having practical components undertaken at the sponsoring company work site. I have explained this to Haymaraj and it suits him well. I have also spoken to him about various course possibilities and we have zoomed onto the Traineeship NITEC in Business Services ITE(W) which has a corresponding Traineeship Higher NITEC in Service Management ITE(W). These courses suit him well as they are conveniently offered in ITE West and are both available as work & study programs.I hope you have sufficient information about Haymaraj to further discussions with him about his education pathway.','11-03-2020','82D11643-1802-9847-9AD6-EE0B09434586','95147490-465A-2646-89ED-EBDEE74EC0A0','terence'),('Thanks a lot.  I will invite Haymaraj next week to ITE college Central and I will show him some of the facilities and also an overview of these courses.

Without understanding Azim, the father may have \'harshly punished\' him, leading to the boy developing physical/mental distress and trauma. Over time, under prolonged abuse, Azim may have then developed Suicide Ideation (SI) which led to his attempts.It was only recently, after moving back to stay with Mdm Yanti, that Azim was referred for formal psychiatric assessment. This happened after yet another attempt, and this time it may be due to the step-father trying to \'discipline\' Azim for being \'difficult\'; again not having understood the boy\'s neurological conditions. The psychiatrist probably understood that Azim suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) brought about by long term harsh discipline measures, brought about by poor understanding of his genetically predisposed neurological conditions. When referred by the psychiatrist for further psychological assessment, Azim indeed returned with ADHD and ODD.To the current parents\' credit, they now probably realize the root cause of Azim\'s problem, hence agreed to participate in a parenting workshop (to better understand & manage Azim) conducted by REACH.

She is always very helpful in assisting members of our Beacon of Life Programme, which is a programme to assist ex-inmates to reintegrate back to the society. Often, she would go beyond her duties, such as bringing the beneficiaries to hospitals for their appointments or accompanying the beneficiaries to agencies when they require help. She was diligent in her accounting work, and normally receive praises for being meticulous. We find it very unfortunate that Celia had appeared to behave inappropriately to a minor.On 26 Mar 20, Tasek Jurong Programme Manager, Nursufi Syafiqah (Sufi), chanced upon a CCTV footage (25 Mar 20, 8.36pm) showing another Tasek Jurong Programme Manager, Celia, what appeared to be hugging, patting & kissing on the head of a 15 year old beneficiary, Nur Jannah (Jannah). Three minutes later, at about 8.39pm, Celia was seen apparently kissing Jannah on the lips. Out of concern, Sufi reviewed the week\'s footage and found that on 23 Mar 20, 9.55pm Celia appeared to be pulling Jannah towards her for a kiss. On both the dates, all other office staff had left and Celia and Jannah were alone.Coincidentally, on 26 Mar 20, Sufi received information from Jannah\'s mother Mdm Mustakimah that Celia had been buying gifts for Jannah, including undergarments, going out together and Celia treating Jannah to meals.On 27 Mar 20, Sufi got from Mdm Mustakimah, a series of WhattsApp screenshots depicting a trend where Celia encouraged or invited Jannah to smoke, and inviting her home. Given all these information, Sufi reported the matter to Tasek Jurong Senior Manager Terence and CEO Faizal. On that same date, Celia invited Jannah to Jurong Point to buy a calculator (that Celia paid for), even though she knew that Jannah was serving a 5-day MC.Interviews set up for Jannah (conducted by Faizal and Sufi), followed by Celia (conducted by Faizal and Terence) on 29 Mar 20 suggested that Jannah was coached to provide non-incriminating answers like absence of physicality, how comfortable she felt with Celia, and her times in the office being far earlier than shown on the footage. For Celia, she maintained that she had done nothing wrong, nothing sexual and that at most she might have crossed some professional ethical lines (buying things and being physically too close to Jannah). Her excuse was that her actions were necessary to develop bond with the beneficiary. It must be noted that Jannah was never a beneficiary assigned to Celia; Celia had insinuated herself to \'help\' Jannah when Jannah had relationship difficulties with her mother, Mdm Mustakimah. Celia admitted that taking Jannah out, at a time when going out when on MC was an offence, was wrong.On 31 Mar 20, Celia\'s employment agreement was terminated. Tasek Jurong, recognizing that Celia was an ex-beneficiary herself, offered her counselling and piecemeal work (book keeping) if she would undertake to stay physically and virtually away from Jannah. Celia was initially agreeable to the undertaking, but after taking more time to consider, eventually rejected it. She claimed she cannot stay away as it would be unfair to deprive Jannah her friendship and support. On that day Celia, having signed the termination letter, was seen to maintain her company with Jannah.On 2 Apr 20, Mdm Mustakimah informed Sufi that Jannah, within the last two days, had become unbearably defiant, refused to come into Tasek Jurong for her e-learning, instead left the house, without the mother\'s permission, to go to Celia\'s home (supposedly for e-learning). That day, both were seen out having lunch together. Out of concern for the developing situation, Tasek Jurong put in place stepped-up support for Jannah and her mother through Programme Managers Sufi and Siti, as well as alerting Jannah\'s school counsellor to keep a closer eye on her.Given the worrying situation, Sufi was tasked to review the CCTV footage for the preceding weeks and these were observed:17 Mar 20, 9.58pm Celia used her hand to rub Jannah\'s cheek.22 Mar 20, 8.43pm Celia patted Jannah on her head, 8.45pm Celia placed her head against Jannah\'s head, 9.06pm Celia kissed Jannah\'s head, 9.15pm Celia placed her hand over Jannah\'s shoulder, 9.20pm Celia placed her hand on Jannah\'s thigh, (9.46pm Celia again patted Jannah on the head.23 Mar 20, 4.04pm Celia held Jannah\'s thigh, 4.22pm Celia kissed Jannah\'s head, 9.53pm Celia held Jannah\'s head, 9.56pm Celia pinched Jannah\'s ear and moved as if to blow her a kiss.25 Mar 20, 5.47pm Celia helping Jannah put on a jacket then held her hand and patted her head, 5.54pm Celia rubbing Jannah\'s head, 5.59pm Celia patted Jannah\'s head, 6.01pm Celia tapped Jannah\'s cheek twice, 6.32pm Celia hugged Jannah and had her hands on Jannah\'s neck, 7.00pm Celia hugged and massaged Jannah\'s back, 8.21pm Celia had her hands around Jannah;s shoulders, 8.24pm Celia again had her hands around Jannah\'s shoulders, THE REST WERE DESCRIBED ABOVE AS ORIGINAL FINDINGS.List of Parties named1.

Recently I have learnt from Shern’s lawyers that she had been arrested recently, and possibly faces two further charges relating to possession of a knife, and is now being held in remand and under solitary confinement. Her case comes up for further PTC on 27 Feb 2019. Shern’s lawyers (pro-bono) from K&L Gates Straits Law have made representations to AGC on the charges. I am writing this appeal as her MP, having delved with my senior volunteers into the facts of her life and circumstances surrounding the incidents in question. I am also attaching: an IMH Medical Record (IMH MR) dated 14 Feb 2019, written by Dr Christopher Cheok, Senior Consultant; and Shern’s account of her life.  I urge that Shern’s present problems be seen in the context of her very difficult childhood and injurious growing years, and the considerable psychological stress arising from her gender dysphoria. Her early background: parents’ divorce, separation from her mother, constant physical abuse by her two brothers, her father’s string of women in the home, and also his absences.Her gender dysphoria, diagnosed by  IMH and immediately evident, remains central in her consciousness, and fuels anxiety over being accepted.  Shern is in sum a deeply injured person, struggling to gain acceptance and stability. I believe the actions described in the charges, if true, would be better and properly addressed through psychological care and treatment rather than imprisonment. My appeal is for AGC to ask for her to be subject to a Mandatory Treatment Order, with expert advice of social workers and psychiatric experts being sought on a programme of rehabilitation. To elaborate, there are three essential matters that guide this appeal : First : The troubled history of home life that was unsettling - one of rejection, abuse by her male siblings, and the patent absence of love. (Please see Shern’s account of her life.) Her personal life has also been challenging, as she underwent hormonal treatment and has desired gender reassignment surgery (IMH MR refers). Second :  Prior to 2015, Shern had been managing these very difficult personal challenges in her life. There had been brief episodes of “pill taking” and an involvement in a fight (25 years ago) for which she went to jail – but she endeavored to and was able to hold together her life. She was first treated at IMH in 2012. But the  IMH MR and Shern’s own account add up to a picture of how, until 2015, she led a hard work and self-reliance and had a close intimate relationship (with another woman). In 2015, she lost her job as a senior tour coordinator (after an MOE rule change that required that such personnel  cannot have past criminal records).  The same year she broke off with her girlfriend. Shern’s life has unravelled since then. From that year she needed serious help from IMH. (Please note that Shern’s  “10 past admissions to IMH” began in 2015; four  times in 2015 alone. See IMH MR para 3a.) Third : Apart from the fighting incident 25 years ago for which she was imprisoned (1994 to 1996), Shern has shown no proclivity to be violent. Shern also strongly believes that the new mix of medication prescribed by IMH and which she first took on 27 Feb 2018 led in her case to  reactions that she cannot accurately describe, and contributed to her otherwise uncontrolled and inexplicable action on 28 Feb 2018 (alleged strangling of her close friend).  I should add some brief observations on Shern’s relationship with Cindy Cheng. I have seen Shern at my MPS some six or more times in the past few months. She is often with her friend Ms Cheng  (NB Ms Cheng is  “victim(A1)”  identified in Charge 5;  of the previous 5 charges being levelled against Shern, two charges involve her friend Ms Cheng as victim).  Cindy Cheng has accompanied Shern to my MPS, and is strongly supportive of her[1].  However, Ms Cheng has expressed several times her deep worry that Shern will effectively relapse. At my MPS,  Shern,  often emotional and in tears, has been calm and well-reasoned if she is given time and is listened to.  When given respect, she is clear minded. She has also been consistently concerned for Ms Cheng’s emotional state, safety and privacy, asking that Ms Cheng  be helped independently of her. Meanwhile I understand Ms Cheng has requested to see Shern and has not been able to do so. Her lawyers have also not been able to do so. .  Appeal The representation to AGC to abandon specific charges against Shern has been made by Shern’s lawyers to your office.  My letter as MP urges psychiatric intervention, and treatment for Shern.  What is pivotal in Shern’s account is that it appears that she has not, since the 1994 fight, been violent to anyone. This fact is relevant  to  four of the seven charges, underlying which is the assumption that she may be prone to violence.    With regard to the events of 28 Feb 2018, which led to the strangling charge. Shern strongly believes that the new list of drugs prescribed by IMH on 27 Feb 2018[2]  and taken by her from that day had unexpected interactions with her, possibly compounded by the alcohol she had had on 28 Feb 2018. She believes the new mix of drugs she took on 28 Feb 2018 led to her uncontrolled actions on the evening of 28 Feb 2019, after an evening of drinking at a karaoke lounge.  Shern says she recalls little of what transpired and only knows what she has been told. I have no evidence that the drugs would produce untoward effects, and none from IMH. There is however a coincidence in her uncontrolled behaviour of 28 feb 2019 and the new drugs prescribed. Speaking without medical expertise, I would expect that there is a fair amount that is not known about an individual’s interactions with drugs.  Finally, it bears reproducing paras 10 and 11 of IMH Medical Report: 10.    “  Shern Chen has        	a) Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)        	b) History of Major Depressive Disorder        	c) History of substance abuse – glue, methamphetamine, benzodiazepine    	    d) History of alcohol abuse – binge drinking pattern        	e) History of multiple episodes of self cutting and drug overdose.        	f) History of Gender Dysphoria. (She considered sex reassignment before). 11.   	The domestic stressors (less than ideal parenting, domestic violence, sibling abuse, father who was a gambler and alcoholic, parental divorce) she was exposed to as a teenager contributed to the development of her psychiatric illnesses except gender dysphoria. “ In sum, Shern Chen has had a life filled with injury and rejection. It underlines the urgency of her getting full medical and psychiatric attention, without which the underlying problems will continue to eat into her. I hope further imprisonment can be avoided.','04-05-2020','01A675B3-5615-A04B-ACB4-B288C2257C75','8CA3FFBF-8F61-A24D-AA8B-F14ECE6783C4','Leibing'),('TJ made meal arrangements with the Food Bank during the Circuit Breaker period.

According to Shern, there was a tenant that was supposed to be living at Shern’s place whilst she’s in prison. The rental money was supposed to go to Shern’s bank account. However, she discovered recently that there were only 4 months worth of rental fees inside - another 18 months were missing. She managed to get in touch with the tenant, just to discover that Cindy told the tenant to transfer to Cindy’s own bank account instead. (Background: before going in, Shern authorized Cindy to handle all these for her whilst she’s in prison.) Shern tried to contact Cindy over this but to no avail. Roughly around 22nd May Shern saw Cindy outside, with her boyfriend. Shern recounted getting beaten by Cindy’s boyfriend. I advised Shern that there were two options: one, she can try to contact Cindy to ask her to return the money, or two, that if she can get the available evidence, it is possible to consider beginning a legal process to get the money back from Cindy. I made it clear I am not an expert on this and that this is a possibility, Shern understood and was appreciative. Shern said that the first option was exhausted because she couldn’t get to Cindy. I told her to pass me the following for us to take a look:  The bank statement from the OCBC bank manager who is assisting her in the investigation of this case (which includes transfers between tenant to Cindy’s account), as well as her own bank statement showing the 4 transfersScreenshot of the tenant saying that he transferred to Cindy The authorization letter that Shern has for Cindy  However, she does not have data and her wifi application needs to wait till 1st June.

She couldn’t get the bail herself, and afterwards the friend in ICU got bail for her.  When she narrated the incident, she wasn’t too worried about this issue.

Syuja has 2 elder brothers (27yo working and 20yo in NS), one other elder sister (25yo student nurse who suffers from depression), and one younger sister (11yo in Rainbow Centre, special needs and paralysed waist down). The siblings generally do not communicate with each other, but the 2 working siblings and Syuja contribute to the care of the 11yo sister. It is very difficult to contact the parents.2.

Help from Fei Yue seems to be only in support of the mother\'s issues.3. Syuja - She was warded in IMH beginning of June 20 due to a suicide attempt and this time round, her warding in IMH is due to the School Counsellor\'s assessment that her suicide ideation is still very high. Syuja is stressed about the medical bills resulting from her treatment, which became an obstacle for her getting medical attention. Her previous hospitalization bills are not fully paid up, and this has resulted in conflicts at home. IMH social worker had reported to the school that Syuja had confided her family members do not talk to each other.4. Course of Action - School Counsellor assessed that Syuja\'s situation has met the criteria for onward reporting to Child Protection Services for medical neglect; report made. I believe all under-aged family members need to be considered for state protection. Of immediate concern is some financial assurance to Syuja so that she can wholeheartedly receive medical help, but this cannot be effected through her absent parents. Further longer term financial support for the family, especially Syuja, her mother, Syiga and the 11yo is necessary. Fei Yue should be alerted to assess the whole family situation.Faizal and Rasyidah assigned to do house visit.

The school may consider writing to CPS (Syuja\'s medical neglect already filed), cc to Mr T, expressing concerns about the mother\'s capacity to manage the funds in the care of the recipient children. Knowing that CPS tends to be overwhelmed with cases, Mr T can perhaps request CPS for urgent assignment of a CPO to review the case.Additional information from SC Elaine:Mother - diagnosed with depression in 2018, receiving support from Fei Yue.- retrenched when Syuja was 14yo and had debts to pay off.- not sure if she is detached from reality, but has been difficult to contact, however, mother managed to call School Counsellor when admitting Syuja and was confused why as she said Syuja seemed quiet and fine at home.Caretaking of the 11yo is by the 20, 19, and 18yosOlder brother and older sister are pushing responsibility to one another.

This lasted for a short period of time until covid 19 affected her business and she had to stop due to all the safety measures and regulations  -assessed that client has desire to work as well and in recent sessions, have been relatively open to exploring part time options which do not clash with her child care arrangements. Client expressed that she hopes to be able to work due to be able to alleviate her financial stress and be more able to cope with the family’s expenses  -client’s husband has also been unemployed for a significant period of time last year due to his gout condition which was quite serious at that time. However, from late last year, with gradual improvement in his condition and overall mobility and functioning, he was able to start working part time. He was eventually able to work full time as a delivery assistant. Husband assessed to have a pattern of ‘job hopping’ or not being able to stay in the job for a stable period as he has been in and out of full time positions relatively often. Most recent update from client during Aug session was husband is out of job again and currently looking for another job as delivery assistant. Caseworker is following up to assist husband in the above. Social support: -assessed that client has low informal social support system due to lack of close friends around her with whom she can rely on for additional support -client shares a close relationship with both her sister and niece. Assessed that both render client some form of occasional emotional support to client. There was a interim period of time when niece was in transition after secondary school and helped with providing client with additional caregiving support. This has since ceased after niece went on to ITE. -assessed that client is not close with the rest of her immediate and extended family members and have not been in contact with them for a long period of time.  Marital relationship/dynamics: -there was a relatively high frequency/intensity of marital conflict/arguments assessed and reported as main stressor for client in mid 2019.  -main issue then was husband was not involved in supporting client with caregiving , even on his off days. Husband was working a new job then and also spent long hours at work, often reaching home late; i.e. around 9pm daily. Husband also told his company that he wanted to do ‘more overtime duties’ in order to get additional income, although client would rather he comes back home on time to support her in the caregiving and house chores. -there was also lack of communication, understanding and support between client and husband. -through a mixture of individual sessions conducted with both client and husband and joint sessions, both were able to gradually address and work on their issues. Marital situation and dynamics gradually improved and became more stable. Current status assessed as stable, connected and no longer reported as a stressor for client. Parent-child relationship and dynamics: -client’s and husband relationship with her children reported  as generally close and connected even though there are existing parenting challenges and behavioral issues of children.-although husband is busy at work, he does make time to bring the family out for dinner or short outings outdoors during his off days. The children usually look forward to these outings and gatherings. -both client and husband have history of adopting permissive style of parenting since the children were young.  -assessed that both face challenges in addressing and dealing with some of the children’s negative behaviors; i.e. school refusal and gaming issues of 2 eldest sons. Client has been unable to make significant progress with regard to this and on many occasions have reported and expressed her resulting caregiver stress due to inability to manage and cope with children’s negative behaviors.  -caseworker has worked with client and husband on effective and positive parenting approaches -caseworker also continued to monitor and emphasize to client about safety and overall well being of children after receiving regular updates from lakeside primary school and fuhua primary school; as well as whenever occasional updates are received from my first skool. School attendance and behavior: -eldest son has school attendance issues and long standing pattern of truancy and not attending school (on and off) -however, when eldest son is present in school, he has no outstanding misbehavior or concerns highlighted from the school -caseworker has been working closely with Lakeside Primary School’s teachers, DM, VP and principal in collaborative case management efforts to engage son and also addressing this issue with parents. (currently still ongoing). Nizam recently started attending ESU after school program is assessed to be receptive to intervention at Lakeside Family Services-second eldest son, age 10 also has occasional school attendance issues, but less concerning as compared to eldest son’s attendance. Similarly, case worker has also been working closely with Fuhua Primary school to address this issue -both eldest and second eldest sons have some degree of gaming addiction issues and would tend to sleep late at night due to playing HP games. This would cause them to have trouble waking up the next day for school. They would also spend relatively long hours playing HP games -caseworker has addressed this with client and discussed effective parenting approaches and methods to curb and reduce their gaming behavior. (still ongoing) Financial situation and coping ability: -client has long term history of reliance on SSO financial assistance to cope with expenses  -client currently just still on SSO F.A, renewed recently -client receives regular food rations from agency, ad hoc donations in cash and kind and LOR subsidies applied to alleviate her financial burden -during the short period of time when client was involved in her home-based food business, there was a slight improvement in the family’s income and stability of client’s financial stress/burden. However this was short lived as client was eventually unable to continue her home business due to covid 19 and resulting regulations/measures. -coping with financial stress/burden continues to be a challenge for the family. -it is assessed that client and husband have some challenges in effective budgeting strategies. Ongoing intervention and psycho-ed conducted by caseworker to address this.  Client’s emotional and mental state: -client diagnosed with depression and prescribed anti-depressants for 3-6 months period upon each follow up review at IMH -assessed that client has pattern of unstable and erratic medical compliance with regard to follow up appointments and her medication -case worker often has to remind her to go for follow up appointments and also take her medication regularly. -assessed that client’s emotional/mental stability is affected by her lack of medical compliance. Client was previously unable to regulate emotions and was highly stressed/overwhelmed/impulsive/anxious etc during the period of time (3rd quarter 2019) when she did not go for follow up for a couple of months and she had ran out of antidepressants to help her cope with her emotions and stressors.  -this was the episode which resulted in client’s emotional/mental state being very unstable and volatile. Client would be easily triggered by various stressors; i.e. at that point of time being her frequent marital conflict and poor relationship with husband combined with financial stress and high caregiver stress. This resulted in an episode of moderate-high suicide risk/ideation and concrete plan as well. During that episode, client reported having frequent ideation and even walked out of the house in the middle of the night on a few occasion to a nearby block. Client was reported to have just ‘stood at the top floor of the building and contemplated jumping off.’ However client did not go ahead with anything and would head back home awhile later after ‘airing her thoughts’. Client verbalized that she was ‘unable to do it’ whenever she thought about her children and ‘what would become of them and her family if she was gone.’ During the above episode, caseworker worked closely with key community partners and also informed client’s husband as a protective measure and added element of monitoring of client’s daily safety and movements. Fortunately, suicide risk was gradually address, worked through and de-escalated via frequent counselling sessions and client was also eventually able to be complaint to follow up at IMH and anti-depressant medication which helped her to cope better with her emotions and stress. To date: no suicide ideation/plan for the last 9 months+    -in view of case history thus far, past intervention with client and client’s emotional/mental state, it is assessed and hypothesized that client tends to be ‘stuck’ in a ‘cycle of differing stressors’. In this regard, client has tendency and pattern to be emotionally/mentally overwhelmed by one particular stressor or combination of stressors and after working through with client for some time, that particular stressor would have a reduced impact on client. Client would then be affected/overwhelmed by another particular stressor subsequently. This is manifested in the pattern of case history ; i.e. main stressor transiting from marital conflict-caregiving stress-suicide risk-financial stress-parenting challenges. There have also been instances in which client might ‘go backwards’ and be stressed or overwhelmed by the similar recurring stressor; i.e. eg parenting challenges and financial burden etc.-client also experienced high caregiver stress especially during the CB period and where there was frequent home based learning conducted from the various schools involved. Client verbalized and expressed stress and being overwhelmed as well when many stakeholders were contacting the family for \'the same issues\'. case worker processed and address this with client and assisted client to link up and communicate with the various agencies involved and to provide key updates as well.-regular interventions/check ins conducted with regard to supporting and working with client\'s emotional needs and stressors.     Summary of Intervention and Action Taken: Ongoing and regular counselling and emotional support (relatively frequent via mixture of scheduled and unscheduled phone sessions, home visits, client walking into agency etc). Client has tendency to contact worker whenever she is distressed or overwhelmed and unable to cope with negative emotions. Caseworker has taken necessary measures to address this with client and client is aware that caseworker will not be able to attend to client be it via phone or walk in each time she is stressed or anxious/overwhelmed etc Previously, conducted several marital sessions with client when marital issues were main point of stress for client (second half of 2019) Conducted and discussed safety plan with client (when client had moderate-high suicide risk i.e. 3rd quarter 2019) Frequent correspondences via email and phone conversations with various stakeholders with regard to client various stressors and issues Several case conferences conducted previously at eldest and second eldest sons’ schools respectively to address attendance and behavioural issues as well as discussing collaborative case management efforts/plans.  Case conference conducted with younger children’s preschool to address learning and development issues, attendance and parenting concerns.regular monitoring and addressing with client on safety and overall well being of the 3 pre school children when occasional updates are provided from My First Skoolcasworker followed up on update from My first Skool about the younger children\'s attendance when most recent update was given by the school in Aug 2020.

Norhayati intially mentioned that she did not know how to change the password and agreed to contact her mobile telco company to assist her in customizing and changing the password accordingly.I also took the opportunity to remind her to produce the note for the school accordingly with regard to the release of Nadra from school as stipulated in your earlier email. Norhayati agreed to do so and will be submitting this note to the school ASAPAside to Andrew: I have also informed Norhayati of your efforts in engaging the family and Nizam for sessions and that you were unable to get her reply or response so far. Norhayati expressed her apologies and verbalized that \"there were just too many things happening over the past few weeks in relation to her children and many people contacting and calling her to ask her about her children\'s attendance\". As such, Norhayati expressed that she probably missed it out. I have reminded her to response accordingly and she has also agreed that she will be willing to work closely with Lakeside Family Services moving forward. Another update on Norhayati\'s medical compliance and follow up sessions at IMH: Norhayati updated me that she has already re-scheduled the follow up appointment and gave me her word that she will not miss this appointment. I also reminded her not to miss her regular appointments and follow  up in lieu of her mental health and emotional/mental state. She has also given me her word to comply to her routine medication after the follow up appointment accordinglyI also reminded her about her previous agreement to all of us of ensuring attendance of the children once school reopened on 29 June 2020 . Norhayati expressed  that she is aware of this and has been and will be trying her best efforts with regard to this. However she also expressed that it is certainly an uphill battle for her daily in terms of managing the children\'s behavioral issues. In light of the above, I also spent considerable time allowing her to ventilate her emotions and processed with her accordinglyMoving forward, I would like to call upon the support and understanding of all our valued partners here to consider the various complex issues and multiple stressors that the family is undergoing and although I am in full agreement with all of you that attendance and academic performance of the children in school is of paramount importance; however it is to my knowledge and assessment of the family\'s situation so far that Norhayati has been trying very hard to address her children\'s issues and would really need all our continued support, empathy and understanding in order to assist her and the family to eventually overcome their issues and move forward together.Thank you all very much for all your continued support, understanding and collaborative efforts thus far in working with the family.

This lasted for a short period of time until covid 19 affected her business and she had to stop due to all the safety measures and regulations  -assessed that client has desire to work as well and in recent sessions, have been relatively open to exploring part time options which do not clash with her child care arrangements. Client expressed that she hopes to be able to work due to be able to alleviate her financial stress and be more able to cope with the family’s expenses  -client’s husband has also been unemployed for a significant period of time last year due to his gout condition which was quite serious at that time. However, from late last year, with gradual improvement in his condition and overall mobility and functioning, he was able to start working part time. He was eventually able to work full time as a delivery assistant. Husband assessed to have a pattern of ‘job hopping’ or not being able to stay in the job for a stable period as he has been in and out of full time positions relatively often. Most recent update from client during Aug session was husband is out of job again and currently looking for another job as delivery assistant. Caseworker is following up to assist husband in the above. Social support: -assessed that client has low informal social support system due to lack of close friends around her with whom she can rely on for additional support -client shares a close relationship with both her sister and niece. Assessed that both render client some form of occasional emotional support to client. There was a interim period of time when niece was in transition after secondary school and helped with providing client with additional caregiving support. This has since ceased after niece went on to ITE. -assessed that client is not close with the rest of her immediate and extended family members and have not been in contact with them for a long period of time.  Marital relationship/dynamics: -there was a relatively high frequency/intensity of marital conflict/arguments assessed and reported as main stressor for client in mid 2019.  -main issue then was husband was not involved in supporting client with caregiving , even on his off days. Husband was working a new job then and also spent long hours at work, often reaching home late; i.e. around 9pm daily. Husband also told his company that he wanted to do ‘more overtime duties’ in order to get additional income, although client would rather he comes back home on time to support her in the caregiving and house chores. -there was also lack of communication, understanding and support between client and husband. -through a mixture of individual sessions conducted with both client and husband and joint sessions, both were able to gradually address and work on their issues. Marital situation and dynamics gradually improved and became more stable. Current status assessed as stable, connected and no longer reported as a stressor for client. Parent-child relationship and dynamics: -client’s and husband relationship with her children reported  as generally close and connected even though there are existing parenting challenges and behavioral issues of children.-although husband is busy at work, he does make time to bring the family out for dinner or short outings outdoors during his off days. The children usually look forward to these outings and gatherings. -both client and husband have history of adopting permissive style of parenting since the children were young.  -assessed that both face challenges in addressing and dealing with some of the children’s negative behaviors; i.e. school refusal and gaming issues of 2 eldest sons. Client has been unable to make significant progress with regard to this and on many occasions have reported and expressed her resulting caregiver stress due to inability to manage and cope with children’s negative behaviors.  -caseworker has worked with client and husband on effective and positive parenting approaches -caseworker also continued to monitor and emphasize to client about safety and overall well being of children after receiving regular updates from lakeside primary school and fuhua primary school; as well as whenever occasional updates are received from my first skool. School attendance and behavior: -eldest son has school attendance issues and long standing pattern of truancy and not attending school (on and off) -however, when eldest son is present in school, he has no outstanding misbehavior or concerns highlighted from the school -caseworker has been working closely with Lakeside Primary School’s teachers, DM, VP and principal in collaborative case management efforts to engage son and also addressing this issue with parents. (currently still ongoing). Nizam recently started attending ESU after school program is assessed to be receptive to intervention at Lakeside Family Services-second eldest son, age 10 also has occasional school attendance issues, but less concerning as compared to eldest son’s attendance. Similarly, case worker has also been working closely with Fuhua Primary school to address this issue -both eldest and second eldest sons have some degree of gaming addiction issues and would tend to sleep late at night due to playing HP games. This would cause them to have trouble waking up the next day for school. They would also spend relatively long hours playing HP games -caseworker has addressed this with client and discussed effective parenting approaches and methods to curb and reduce their gaming behavior. (still ongoing) Financial situation and coping ability: -client has long term history of reliance on SSO financial assistance to cope with expenses  -client currently just still on SSO F.A, renewed recently -client receives regular food rations from agency, ad hoc donations in cash and kind and LOR subsidies applied to alleviate her financial burden -during the short period of time when client was involved in her home-based food business, there was a slight improvement in the family’s income and stability of client’s financial stress/burden. However this was short lived as client was eventually unable to continue her home business due to covid 19 and resulting regulations/measures. -coping with financial stress/burden continues to be a challenge for the family. -it is assessed that client and husband have some challenges in effective budgeting strategies. Ongoing intervention and psycho-ed conducted by caseworker to address this.  Client’s emotional and mental state: -client diagnosed with depression and prescribed anti-depressants for 3-6 months period upon each follow up review at IMH -assessed that client has pattern of unstable and erratic medical compliance with regard to follow up appointments and her medication -case worker often has to remind her to go for follow up appointments and also take her medication regularly. -assessed that client’s emotional/mental stability is affected by her lack of medical compliance. Client was previously unable to regulate emotions and was highly stressed/overwhelmed/impulsive/anxious etc during the period of time (3rd quarter 2019) when she did not go for follow up for a couple of months and she had ran out of antidepressants to help her cope with her emotions and stressors.  -this was the episode which resulted in client’s emotional/mental state being very unstable and volatile. Client would be easily triggered by various stressors; i.e. at that point of time being her frequent marital conflict and poor relationship with husband combined with financial stress and high caregiver stress. This resulted in an episode of moderate-high suicide risk/ideation and concrete plan as well. During that episode, client reported having frequent ideation and even walked out of the house in the middle of the night on a few occasion to a nearby block. Client was reported to have just ‘stood at the top floor of the building and contemplated jumping off.’ However client did not go ahead with anything and would head back home awhile later after ‘airing her thoughts’. Client verbalized that she was ‘unable to do it’ whenever she thought about her children and ‘what would become of them and her family if she was gone.’ During the above episode, caseworker worked closely with key community partners and also informed client’s husband as a protective measure and added element of monitoring of client’s daily safety and movements. Fortunately, suicide risk was gradually address, worked through and de-escalated via frequent counselling sessions and client was also eventually able to be complaint to follow up at IMH and anti-depressant medication which helped her to cope better with her emotions and stress. To date: no suicide ideation/plan for the last 9 months+    -in view of case history thus far, past intervention with client and client’s emotional/mental state, it is assessed and hypothesized that client tends to be ‘stuck’ in a ‘cycle of differing stressors’. In this regard, client has tendency and pattern to be emotionally/mentally overwhelmed by one particular stressor or combination of stressors and after working through with client for some time, that particular stressor would have a reduced impact on client. Client would then be affected/overwhelmed by another particular stressor subsequently. This is manifested in the pattern of case history ; i.e. main stressor transiting from marital conflict-caregiving stress-suicide risk-financial stress-parenting challenges. There have also been instances in which client might ‘go backwards’ and be stressed or overwhelmed by the similar recurring stressor; i.e. eg parenting challenges and financial burden etc.-client also experienced high caregiver stress especially during the CB period and where there was frequent home based learning conducted from the various schools involved. Client verbalized and expressed stress and being overwhelmed as well when many stakeholders were contacting the family for \'the same issues\'. case worker processed and address this with client and assisted client to link up and communicate with the various agencies involved and to provide key updates as well.-regular interventions/check ins conducted with regard to supporting and working with client\'s emotional needs and stressors.     Summary of Intervention and Action Taken: Ongoing and regular counselling and emotional support (relatively frequent via mixture of scheduled and unscheduled phone sessions, home visits, client walking into agency etc). Client has tendency to contact worker whenever she is distressed or overwhelmed and unable to cope with negative emotions.

A significant part of the home visit session was spent to process and attempt to work through the resistance and reluctance as This was the first time maslan opened up to share about  a particular experience with Ms Faizal which may have caused some misunderstandings and negative experiences for the family. According to them, this happened in either 2018 or 2019 from his memory. I spent a considerable time trying  to mediate and help both understand where we as stakeholders are coming from and the purpose of our intentional efforts to support them; however maslan expressed that although he understands the importance of the additional support to accompany the children and Ensure that their attendance is regular , it could be assessed that both were still uncomfortable and not keen with the chaperone initiative at this juncture despite All my efforts to mediate, process and explain.I went on to explore and discuss alternatives in order to Ensure children attendance and both requested that for the next one month; I.e 14 Sep-14 oct,maslan and Yati will bring their kids to the school every day. Maslan agreed and committed to being involved as well during this period , until he finds new employment and in the event he starts a new job, Yati expressed that she will continue to bring the kids on her own. She added that if she needs additional support if maslan starts work, she will inform the school accordingly. Both are in agreement too that if at any point of time , they fail to do so within this 1 month ‘trial’ period except for the exception of medical leave, the school would then come in to support with accompanying the children to school.With regard to the above, appreciate the school could inform us promptly if the parents did bring the kids to school as committed and agreed and I will then contact them to address this accordingly.(@faizal: I was just wondering if it could be helpful to re-establish and recalibrate the therapeutic relationship with the family in order to improve the effectiveness of our Long term Support and interventions with the family.

Cos I\'ve just learned that in order to succeed with big goals, I need to have small goals so that it can be a stepping stone for me to achieve the big goals..The other thing is that here I\'ve learned how to be patient.. Cos sometimes things don\'t go the way we want.. And also different institutions in different ways.. Right now I was at PRC and the rules here are quite \'Chia Lak\'.. But till now I still manage to be in good shape and also have good conduct.. Cos I realise that not everything we want will come easily and no challenges.. Basically for me, I take this as a challenge in life in order to change.. And for me the good thing about having difficulties facing the rule here is that it helps me to build my discipline.. I always tell myself that if I can\'t comply with the rules and regulations in here, how am I going to comply with the rules out there.. So slowly things start to change bit by bit and I\'m also proud that this time round I manage to overcome some of the challenges here.. That\'s all regarding me here.. I\'ll keep you updated about what\'s my planning once I release it here in my next E-letter..Lastly I would like to apologise for not being a good mentee of yours.. I also want to apologise for making you disappointed with my relapsed.. I hope you can forgive me and give a second chance to come back into Beacon Of Life.. I am really proud to have you, Darren Tan and Kim Whye Kee as friend and also a mentor that has guided me in the past.. But in the end up I took things for granted.. But this time round I really hope that the door is open for me to join you guys again.. And frankly speaking, what I can say is that I really need support from you guys.. The fact is that once I release from here there are more obstacles and challenges I\'m going to face and I\'m not ashamed to say that I\'m not strong enough to face those challenges.. Cos I know myself better that I\'m weak and in order to overcome it I need support from you guys..Ok lah Peng Guan, that\'s all for now.. I will write to you again once I get your reply.. I hope you can update me with the news about what is happening out there.. And also send my regards to Mr Faizal and to the rest of Beacon Of Life members who know me.. That\'s all..

Life is tough now, it is okay if you fix your goal and work towards it. So what kind of classes are you going through right now ? What have you learnt from the classes ? What is the best method and what is the worse one ? What can you do after your release ? How to achieve your goal ? Short term goal and long term goal ? I am currently doing my part time Master in Social work degree at SUSS. It is extremely tired....not easy bro.....As for our BOL, it is a lot better and they are waiting for me outside. I got in touch with your mother and asked her for your prison number.  Please do remember to come find me after your release. Take care and stay safe. Yours SincerelyPeng  Guan','21-05-2020','4D83922A-A630-E243-9D29-FF77C9E31482','DDEDB26B-91F2-1344-8AF4-1C15BE8B8315','David Siow'),('Hey Peng Guan,Life here has been good.. Well food and stuff all provided so nothing to worry about.. Well classes about changing that I\'ve gone through are Looking Forward (LF), Be My Healthy Self (BMHS) & Integrated Criminogenic Programme (ICP) which I\'ve already completed all of them.. The only courses left were NTUC and some logistic courses.. Which I find very good lah.. Cause by taking some NTUC courses it helps me to upgrade myself.. Which is my first step on my change plan.. Cos if I don\'t upgrade myself and don\'t move on or stay in my comfort zone.. It will make me stay in my zone and it will go nowhere.. So what I believe now is that in order to change I need to leave my comfort zone.Find something new which benefits me or go for courses that help me to upgrade myself.. Well in the Pre-Release Centre there are many courses so I just follow up the class only now.. But since April till now NTUC course classes have been cancelled for how long I don\'t know.. This is due to Covid-19.. But I hope by this July everything will resume back as per normal.What I\'ve learnt from the classes I completed is all good for me.. The best method is Cost Benefit Analysis bro.. This is the best and useful method for me.. By doing this method I realised that by taking drug is costs me more than benefits me.. And it doesn\'t only cost me short term but it cost me long term.. Things like my freedom, my family and friends.. And it only benefits me short term.. Things like getting high, free from problems and enjoy.. This is all short term benefits for me.. When I sit and self-reflect about what I\'ve done, it knock me hard.. It make me realised and give me a wake up call.. The worst thing is about breathing techniques.. Haha.. I still don\'t get it actually about what this technique is link or help you change.. But never mind, even if I don\'t understand about it, at least I got some knowledge about it.So what can I do once I release after settling my own stuff is I\'ll try to find a full time job around Jurong area.. Cos by having a job nearer to my home I get to spend time with my loved ones after work. If not then I will go for what SCORE has recommend we lorr.. The reason why I want to find a job near my house is because it\'s far from Selarang where I\'ll need to go after I release this is what I know lah.. So by spending my time with family after work it helps me to stay away from bad company in the MAS.. I\'ve heard many things happening there so I take this as a way to avoid it.. Cos I know that if I get back early I need to face some people and some stuff in there.. Well but whatever it is I still need to be back there before 12 A.M.. So after thinking about it, I planned to avoid going back to MAS early.. Unless once I release from here and serve tagging for MAS then there will be another plan for it.. As for what I know right now, we need to go to Selarang MAS once we release.. But there is also news that some selected people can get home tagging for their MAS.. And I pray and hope that I\'ll be one of the selected people.First things that I need to do in order to achieve my goals is to leave my old friends.. Only then I\'ll go for my goals.. Such as obtaining a driving license, gaining my family trust back and staying clean.. As for a driving license I need to be financially stable which is why I need a full time job in the first place.. By gaining my family trust back I need to prove to them that I\'m a change person by proving to them that I can quit drugs and don\'t mix with my old friends.. As for staying clean, like I said before I need to leave my old friends which is the first thing I need to do.As for furthering my studies, what\'s your advice? Should I go for O\'level or straight away go for Nitec courses? Cos my credits for N\'A Level is 17 credits.. And in my mind there are few courses which I\'m interested in.. Mechatronics, Aerospace engineering and Fitness.. If I were to go for Nitec courses I would go for any of this 3.. So what\'s your point of view?I was actually scared to rush things. Cos when we intend to rush things and we get stressed, we will make wrong decisions and it will lead me to relapse. This is what I\'m scared of, \'RELAPSE\'. This is all my backup plans right now. And also these are my answers to the question you gave me.Btw Peng Guan I feel good and happy for you. I wish you all the best and may you succeed for your Master bro. I know it\'s gonna be tiring. But it\'s good to achieve it. I\'m really proud to be your friend. Btw BOL are waiting for me? If waiting for me then I\'m happy to hear about it. The only thing I\'m worried is about their acceptance. This is the problem I have which is low self-esteem. Till now I don\'t know how to overcome it.Peng Guan, there\'s help I need from you, can you help me check whether there are any subsidies I can get if I want to get a motor license? And also do help me check if I want to make my new NRIC how much is the price? Cos mine broke into 4 pieces. Oklah that\'s all for now. I\'ll keep you updated. And not to worry I\'ll find and meet you once I release from here bro. Btw can I know what makes you call my mom out of sudden. I\'m just anxious.. And I was shocked when suddenly seeing your name added to my e-letter.Other than you who add me as a friend. Danish ex BOLA boys And Saifullah also do add me and give me motivation in every letter to keep me motivated. I\'m also happy to have positive peers around like you guys. Who stay with !I through ! Hard time. I really appreciate it bro. That\'s all bro.. Thx for the Hari Raya Wishes too. Send my regards to Darren Tan, Kim Whye Kee and those BOL members who know me. Take care out there bro.. Good bye..Yours Sincerely,Elfiee P/S: Bro, at MPS did any new malay girls join in the programme? Cos the last time I was at the MPS I know 1 malay girl was there.. But now I don\'t know whether she\'s still there or not.. If there are any new chicks do recommend me alrites.. Maybe this time round I can have a relationship with them and have commitment..

Thanks much! Summary of Case Discussion Sakinah’s Safety IssuesIn light of a recent critical incident, Sakinah was placed under the care of foster parents in view of the prevailing safety issues posed to her within the family. Child Protective Service (CPS) brought the case to Youth Court and obtained a Care and Protection Order for Sakinah. The safety concerns are family violence (FV) amongst Mdm Alizah, Mdm Nuraslinda and Mr Azman as well as substance abuse by both parents, Mr Azman and Mdm Haslinda. Professionals shared that the triggers for FV are often over parenting, financial issues as well as disagreements over the parenting of Sakinah, especially when Mdm Haslinda and Mr Azman sought ad hoc shelter at Mdm Alizah’s flat. Mdm Haslinda and Mr Azman do not have stable housing at the moment. While Sakinah was not very verbal about her fears/worries possibly due to her learning deficit, Sakinah had shown apparent signs of being affected by the FV issues at home and strained relationship between the adults. Sakinah has shared with her foster parents that she was afraid to go back to Mdm Alizah’s house and wanted to remain in the care of her foster parents. However, during her supervised access with Ms Alizah, Sakinah had a tendency to pander to her caregiver’s wishes and would indicate that she wanted to return to the care of her grandmother. Professionals working with this family had tried to preserve Sakinah’s placement with Mdm Alizah as much as possible before the critical incident occurred. While issues such as stable housing would need to be looked into, the decision to reunify Sakinah with her parents would be largely dependent on the progress demonstrated by the family in addressing the issues of FV/substance abuse – and these would not necessarily be issues that are resolved in the shorter-term. In the meantime, CPS will ensure that Sakinah’s developmental and learning needs are looked into while she is placed under foster care. School Attendance Issues in Other Childreni)                    HumairahWhile Humairah was noted not to be schooling previously, FST was informed by Mdm Alizah that Humairah will be starting school at Assumption Pathway School (APS) next year. They have bought new uniforms for her and Humairah has expressed her desire to return to school. Mdm Alizah had shared that Humairah had stopped schooling this year as, during the circuit-breaker period, she did not have laptop or phone. As a result, she was not aware of the school schedule and hence, gradually lost touch with the school. Clara from FST will be assisting Mdm Alizah with contacting APS to confirm the plan for Humairah to resume school next year.  ii)                   DanialWhile Danial lives in a separate household, he has a tendency to prefer staying in Mdm Alizah’s house due to her permissive parenting. Danial has been noted to enjoy his freedom, which is something he is unable to get when he lives with his father, who is relatively more strict. Danial was also previously noted to have gone missing for a period of time had during which he stayed with his girlfriend. As a result of the lack of structure provided to Danial, his school attendance has been poor. Thus far, Danial’s school has been trying to work with him through the father to get him to attend school. A referral has recently been made by Danial’s school to an FSC (Skylar/Clara – could you help specify which FSC family was referred to pls?) to follow up on Danial’s school issues and to assist his father with his parenting. Difficulties Working with FamilyAgencies have expressed difficulty working with the family as they are difficult to contact and have a tendency to be non-responsive or be missing. This includes working together with Mr Azman on his shelter arrangement. FST notes that there is a repetitive cycle in which Mdm Nuraslinda and Mr Azman would leave Mdm Alizah’s household due to strained relations, but are unable to sustain living by themselves due to poor employment. They would then return to Mdm Alizah’s house, whereupon another incident of FV would be triggered within a few months due to strained relations. Next StepsCPS and FST will continue working with family to address the concerns of Sakinah’s safety as well as the ongoing cycle of FV in the householdSSO(RST) will work with FST on surfacing an appeal for rental housing for Mdm Nuraslinda and Mr AzmanTasek Jurong will try to ramp up engagement with Mr Azman through their employment programme and leverage his strengths to take up employment and improve his stabilityWhile it would be difficult for Tasek Jurong to engage Danial as there is no relationship or trust established, Tasek will engage Humariah to try to ensure she continues attending school next yearThank you.','15-10-2020','918FE61D-088A-2A41-982B-663CCCD18355','469349E8-DE31-3B4E-A8BB-EA54B873269D','Leibing'),('Izam came at around 8pm; he was wearing quite a smart outfit, and overall he was in good spirit.

Attendance of all children – Nadia (5yo), Irman (6yo), Ivana (3yo) – in My First Skool is very poor. They attend school <10 days a month. Faiza provides regular updates on the poor attendance to Social Worker, James from Fei Yue FSC, via e-mail and phone calls but little intervention has been done on that front according to Faiza. Previously, Nadra (7yo) was also from MFS and had similarly poor attendance. Older brothers, Nizam and Indra who are in our BC programme also has poor attendance in their primary school.2.        Suspected physical punishment:•        Last year, Irman came to school with a bruise on his face. He told teachers that his father had hit him but parents provided a different story (can’t remember what the reason given was). He had a developmental appointment at CDU on that day so Faiza had informed Doctor to take pictures of the bruises. This is on the medical record and Social Worker was informed.•        Faiza did a home visit and saw two bruises on both sides of Irman’s cheek. Mum said that it was due to a fall but when Irman came to school the next day, he said that it was from his brothers kicking him in the face. School also suspects that one of the bruises is due to severe tooth decay.•        Nadia recently came to school with a very apparent hanger mark on her thigh, which still had dried blood. Faiza described it as a mark caused by a hanger splitting open the skin (from the force). School asked Mum about the mark and she said that Father sometimes uses belt to discipline the children (to note that the mark was caused by a hanger so this indicated belts were used on other occasions). During this conversation, Nadra, who had accompanied Mum to fetch her younger siblings, also showed the teacher a mark on her foot, which looked like it came from a cigarette butt. Mum then stopped Nadra from talking and said that Nadra had stepped on “cement” causing her foot to bleed.3.        Social Worker’s assessment and interventions•        SW has not been very proactive in intervention despite school’s updates on attendance and children’s academic delays. Faiza and principal met with SW recently after the recent suspected physical punishments. They raised concerns about attendance and children’s academic performance but SW said he was not aware of these issues despite Faiza providing regular updates. He also raised that there is not much concern since there is no use of physical punishments. School then brought up the incidents in #2. SW suggested removing LOR as one of the ways to motivate parents to send children to school so that they will “feel the pinch”. When school raised that the school fees would not be affordable for the family and it would result in the parents withdrawing the children from school, the SW said he was not aware of the cost of preschool. •        The school is concerned as they have noticed signs of abuse and neglect even though they have limited interactions with the children, which indicates that there may be incidents that the school was not able to catch. They feel that the parent’s compliance to sending the children to school / avoiding physical punishments should be tied to their ComCare assistance instead of LOR but the SW raised that the measure is more complicated. Family is meeting SW and school on 8 April.

Ivana joined us in 2019. In the past 3 years, we have provided various assistance to the family and various programs to help the children\'s learning.To allay any financial worries, each year the children receive 4 sets of school uniforms each for free, $50 funding for field trips, birthday cake on their birthdays, free enrichment programs among many other free programs and services. Parents make little effort to get children to school even for field trips and fun events over the past years. During CB we delivered monthly food rations, dinner meals, prepaid SIM card and Wifi router so that the children could attend online lessons (they did not). Father also came to school to pick up food rations on 29 July. For their learning, our learning support educators have made multiple observations and recommendations for the children. When Nadra was still in our centre, she had Developmental Support Program to help with her learning needs - mainly on language and literacy. Our learning support educator actively engaged both mother and father, assessed their abilities and taught them to use simple and fun educational games to help Nadra. Apart from that, Nadra received small group intervention - Read to Reach in K1 and Flair in K2. However, due to the low attendance, she did not benefit much from the programs. We also recommended for her to retain in K2 so that she will have a chance to catch up and start Primary school with greater confidence. Mother was not keen with the recommendation but Nadra continues to have difficulty coping in Primary school. From the developmental tests, Nadra\'s developmental age was about 2 years behind her chronological(actual) age. We had a case conference with Lakeside Primary and FSC SW to help with her transition to P1.Irman has also been offered assistance by Developmental Support Program for Occupational Therapy and later language and literacy therapy, however due to poor attendance and commitment, he has been dropped out from the programs. He was recommended for speech therapy at JMC last year but his mother refused to send him for the therapy. He continued to have assistance for small group intervention - Read to Reach in K1 and Flair in K2. Irman is also assisted by a Co-classroom facilitator who assists him during lessons and provides in-class coaching to help him participate effectively in large group learning. Attendance continues to be low despite efforts to engage the family. Parents blame the child for not wanting to go to school and throwing tantrums.Nadia has similar learning needs to her siblings. She attends Read to Reach whenever she comes to school but was not offered any Developmental Support Program knowing that attendance has been consistently low. We told parents that she will be offered the learning support only when her attendance improves. When she comes to school, her teachers take time to help her catch up with learning however there is very little progress.Ivana is not meeting her developmental milestones as well. Also, her bag will not be packed accordingly and she will have missing diapers or bring back the dirty clothes/towel from the previous day- teachers had to buy her a clean towel and clean bottle to keep in the centre. The same goes for Nadia and Irman. They will have missing items from their bag when they come to school. When parents are reminded to bring the items, they will scold their children for not packing their own bags properly.Please see the children\'s attendance this year:Child Name        BC        Level        Jan        Feb        Mar        Apr        May        Jun        JulNur Ivana Rizlin Binte Maslan         T1725714A         PG        40%        5%        64%        N.A        N.A        29%        43%Nur Nadia Rizeen Binte Maslan        T1515603H        K1        40%        30%        55%        N.A        N.A        33%        48%Mohammad Irman Rifzi Bin Maslan        T1410516B        K2        50%        30%        64%        N.A        N.A        24%        29%Other concerns that we have is on their health, hygiene and safety. Children walk around the neighbourhood barefooted and always appear unkempt. In our last home visit in March 2020, mother did not wash Ivana immediately after she passed motion and her faeces was on the floor and on her hands. During other home visits, there was a strong urine smell coming from their mattresses so we provided new mattresses and waterproof mattress covers to them. Children also often have bouts of head lice and Nadia has rash outbreaks. We have made appointments for both Nadia and Irman to see a dentist but mother did not follow up. Last year, Nadia\'s face was swollen badly due to an abscess on her gums as her teeth were badly rotting. Mother did not bring her to see a doctor, but instead stopped her from going to school until the swell went down. Nadia also has bad asthma, usually triggered by cough but mother has never provided her ventolin inhaler and instead would keep her away from school. On safety matters, the children continue to roam around the neighbourhood unsupervised, usually wearing My First Skool uniform. In April last year, there was once that Irman came to school with a swollen cheek/ mouth. Irman told teachers that his father hit him and there was blood in his mouth. When we checked, we saw that his inner cheek had a small tear and a little blood. Parents claimed that Irman and Nadia were playing rough and his face hit the wall at home. Earlier this year in March, Nadia came to school with a hanger mark across her thigh. Nadia told teachers that her father hit her. All the above were communicated to Fei Yue FSC as well. Previously, there were joint home visits and case conferences with SW Yongren. When SW James took over the case, we continued to update him via email/ calls and met him in March at the FSC to share all our concerns again as well as the injury to Nadia. We hope more can be done for the children as parents continue to be non-compliant and uncooperative in the children\'s well-being in the past 3 years. We would like to seek the various stakeholders\' collaboration to assist the family in providing the children with their basic needs, care and learning opportunities. Hope the above information is helpful and feel free to let us know if you need any other information on the children.

The discussion eventually centered on Mdm Yati\'s children, specifically #1 Nizam (Lakeside Pri) who has very poor school attendance and #2 Indra (Fuhua Pri) who is showing signs of school refusal (influenced by the elder brother). The parents generally do not provide structures to the children and claim they are unable to control them.As detailed in the email below, My First Skool has reported that school attendance is also a serious concern for the remaining children - #3 Nadra (has since transited to Lakeside Pri 1), while #4 Irman, #5 Nadia and #6 Ivana are still in MFS. Furthermore, #3 - #6 were assessed by MFS to have learning & developmental deficits but intervention cannot be effected due to their poor attendance. Significantly, the email highlights the school\'s concern for the children\'s health and safety, providing details that may border on neglect and possible abuse.Mdm Hayati is understood to have depression, is unable to work and is supported by Fei Yue. Mr Mazlan has gout and is unable to work full time, unable to hold down jobs for long. The family relies largely on FA through SSO. All the schools have extended full support to the children and family (Lakeside Pri had even offered to fetch the kids daily).Tasek recommends that a case conference be convened to find a way forward for this family. A lead agency needs to be identified and the case must be reviewed to derive a course of action to ensure the children\'s health, safety and development.','26-08-2020','EDD17A13-D0CB-B94D-8C2E-0C1A75A23191','2CA58A82-BD3F-BC4E-8083-F832F6EE7C5D','Rasyidah'),('Dear Terence and valued partners. Thank you for your email and continued partnership to support the family with regard to their various complex needs and issues.I would like to provide a summary of key updates/issues of the family and history of our collaborative intervention efforts:Summary of updates on client\'s various systemic issues and concerns:Employment: -client has long history of unemployment due to her long term MC and mental health condition -for a short period of time in start of 2020, client started a small home based business of selling food items. This lasted for a short period of time until covid 19 affected her business and she had to stop due to all the safety measures and regulations  -assessed that client has desire to work as well and in recent sessions, have been relatively open to exploring part time options which do not clash with her child care arrangements. Client expressed that she hopes to be able to work due to be able to alleviate her financial stress and be more able to cope with the family’s expenses  -client’s husband has also been unemployed for a significant period of time last year due to his gout condition which was quite serious at that time. However, from late last year, with gradual improvement in his condition and overall mobility and functioning, he was able to start working part time. He was eventually able to work full time as a delivery assistant. Husband assessed to have a pattern of ‘job hopping’ or not being able to stay in the job for a stable period as he has been in and out of full time positions relatively often. Most recent update from client during Aug session was husband is out of job again and currently looking for another job as delivery assistant. Caseworker is following up to assist husband in the above. Social support: -assessed that client has low informal social support system due to lack of close friends around her with whom she can rely on for additional support -client shares a close relationship with both her sister and niece. Assessed that both render client some form of occasional emotional support to client. There was a interim period of time when niece was in transition after secondary school and helped with providing client with additional caregiving support. This has since ceased after niece went on to ITE. -assessed that client is not close with the rest of her immediate and extended family members and have not been in contact with them for a long period of time.  Marital relationship/dynamics: -there was a relatively high frequency/intensity of marital conflict/arguments assessed and reported as main stressor for client in mid 2019.  -main issue then was husband was not involved in supporting client with caregiving , even on his off days. Husband was working a new job then and also spent long hours at work, often reaching home late; i.e. around 9pm daily. Husband also told his company that he wanted to do ‘more overtime duties’ in order to get additional income, although client would rather he comes back home on time to support her in the caregiving and house chores. -there was also lack of communication, understanding and support between client and husband. -through a mixture of individual sessions conducted with both client and husband and joint sessions, both were able to gradually address and work on their issues. Marital situation and dynamics gradually improved and became more stable. Current status assessed as stable, connected and no longer reported as a stressor for client. Parent-child relationship and dynamics: -client’s and husband relationship with her children reported  as generally close and connected even though there are existing parenting challenges and behavioral issues of children.-although husband is busy at work, he does make time to bring the family out for dinner or short outings outdoors during his off days. The children usually look forward to these outings and gatherings. -both client and husband have history of adopting permissive style of parenting since the children were young.  -assessed that both face challenges in addressing and dealing with some of the children’s negative behaviors; i.e. school refusal and gaming issues of 2 eldest sons. Client has been unable to make significant progress with regard to this and on many occasions have reported and expressed her resulting caregiver stress due to inability to manage and cope with children’s negative behaviors.  -caseworker has worked with client and husband on effective and positive parenting approaches -caseworker also continued to monitor and emphasize to client about safety and overall well being of children after receiving regular updates from lakeside primary school and fuhua primary school; as well as whenever occasional updates are received from my first skool. School attendance and behavior: -eldest son has school attendance issues and long standing pattern of truancy and not attending school (on and off) -however, when eldest son is present in school, he has no outstanding misbehavior or concerns highlighted from the school -caseworker has been working closely with Lakeside Primary School’s teachers, DM, VP and principal in collaborative case management efforts to engage son and also addressing this issue with parents. (currently still ongoing). Nizam recently started attending ESU after school program is assessed to be receptive to intervention at Lakeside Family Services-second eldest son, age 10 also has occasional school attendance issues, but less concerning as compared to eldest son’s attendance. Similarly, case worker has also been working closely with Fuhua Primary school to address this issue -both eldest and second eldest sons have some degree of gaming addiction issues and would tend to sleep late at night due to playing HP games. This would cause them to have trouble waking up the next day for school. They would also spend relatively long hours playing HP games -caseworker has addressed this with client and discussed effective parenting approaches and methods to curb and reduce their gaming behavior. (still ongoing) Financial situation and coping ability: -client has long term history of reliance on SSO financial assistance to cope with expenses  -client currently just still on SSO F.A, renewed recently -client receives regular food rations from agency, ad hoc donations in cash and kind and LOR subsidies applied to alleviate her financial burden -during the short period of time when client was involved in her home-based food business, there was a slight improvement in the family’s income and stability of client’s financial stress/burden. However this was short lived as client was eventually unable to continue her home business due to covid 19 and resulting regulations/measures. -coping with financial stress/burden continues to be a challenge for the family. -it is assessed that client and husband have some challenges in effective budgeting strategies. Ongoing intervention and psycho-ed conducted by caseworker to address this.  Client’s emotional and mental state: -client diagnosed with depression and prescribed anti-depressants for 3-6 months period upon each follow up review at IMH -assessed that client has pattern of unstable and erratic medical compliance with regard to follow up appointments and her medication -case worker often has to remind her to go for follow up appointments and also take her medication regularly. -assessed that client’s emotional/mental stability is affected by her lack of medical compliance. Client was previously unable to regulate emotions and was highly stressed/overwhelmed/impulsive/anxious etc during the period of time (3rd quarter 2019) when she did not go for follow up for a couple of months and she had ran out of antidepressants to help her cope with her emotions and stressors.  -this was the episode which resulted in client’s emotional/mental state being very unstable and volatile. Client would be easily triggered by various stressors; i.e. at that point of time being her frequent marital conflict and poor relationship with husband combined with financial stress and high caregiver stress. This resulted in an episode of moderate-high suicide risk/ideation and concrete plan as well. During that episode, client reported having frequent ideation and even walked out of the house in the middle of the night on a few occasion to a nearby block. Client was reported to have just ‘stood at the top floor of the building and contemplated jumping off.’ However client did not go ahead with anything and would head back home awhile later after ‘airing her thoughts’. Client verbalized that she was ‘unable to do it’ whenever she thought about her children and ‘what would become of them and her family if she was gone.’ During the above episode, caseworker worked closely with key community partners and also informed client’s husband as a protective measure and added element of monitoring of client’s daily safety and movements. Fortunately, suicide risk was gradually address, worked through and de-escalated via frequent counselling sessions and client was also eventually able to be complaint to follow up at IMH and anti-depressant medication which helped her to cope better with her emotions and stress. To date: no suicide ideation/plan for the last 9 months+    -in view of case history thus far, past intervention with client and client’s emotional/mental state, it is assessed and hypothesized that client tends to be ‘stuck’ in a ‘cycle of differing stressors’. In this regard, client has tendency and pattern to be emotionally/mentally overwhelmed by one particular stressor or combination of stressors and after working through with client for some time, that particular stressor would have a reduced impact on client. Client would then be affected/overwhelmed by another particular stressor subsequently. This is manifested in the pattern of case history ; i.e. main stressor transiting from marital conflict-caregiving stress-suicide risk-financial stress-parenting challenges. There have also been instances in which client might ‘go backwards’ and be stressed or overwhelmed by the similar recurring stressor; i.e. eg parenting challenges and financial burden etc.-client also experienced high caregiver stress especially during the CB period and where there was frequent home based learning conducted from the various schools involved. Client verbalized and expressed stress and being overwhelmed as well when many stakeholders were contacting the family for \'the same issues\'. case worker processed and address this with client and assisted client to link up and communicate with the various agencies involved and to provide key updates as well.-regular interventions/check ins conducted with regard to supporting and working with client\'s emotional needs and stressors.     Summary of Intervention and Action Taken: •        Ongoing and regular counselling and emotional support (relatively frequent via mixture of scheduled and unscheduled phone sessions, home visits, client walking into agency etc). Client has tendency to contact worker whenever she is distressed or overwhelmed and unable to cope with negative emotions. Caseworker has taken necessary measures to address this with client and client is aware that caseworker will not be able to attend to client be it via phone or walk in each time she is stressed or anxious/overwhelmed etc •        Previously, conducted several marital sessions with client when marital issues were main point of stress for client (second half of 2019) •        Conducted and discussed safety plan with client (when client had moderate-high suicide risk i.e. 3rd quarter 2019) •        Frequent correspondences via email and phone conversations with various stakeholders with regard to client various stressors and issues •        Several case conferences conducted previously at eldest and second eldest sons’ schools respectively to address attendance and behavioural issues as well as discussing collaborative case management efforts/plans.  •        Case conference conducted with younger children’s preschool to address learning and development issues, attendance and parenting concerns.•        regular monitoring and addressing with client on safety and overall well being of the 3 pre school children when occasional updates are provided from My First Skool•        casworker followed up on update from My first Skool about the younger children\'s attendance when most recent update was given by the school in Aug 2020. Caseworker has discussed with My First Skool worker and joint understanding has been agreed by pre school to provide more timely and regular weekly updates in order for more prompt action and intervention to be followed up upon by caseworker with client.   •         monitoring and ensuring of client’s medical compliance to follow up and prescriptive medication (i.e. anti-depressants) ; i.e. as her emotional/mental state and functioning is co related to medical compliance•          collaborations with other community partners such as Lakeside Family Services ESU worker with regard to their programs/services to engage eldest son with individual counselling and after school programs. •        collaboration with SSO partners to appeal for higher quantum of financial assistance when husband lost his job and face difficulties securing full time employment for significant period of time. (third quarter 2019) •        Assisted husband in job seeking and job matching by linking him up with E2i as well as other suitable job opportunities and openings  •        Continued and ongoing Application and renewal of LOR for client’s 3 younger children attending pre school •        Regular monthly food rations from agency to alleviate financial burden •        Application of YWCA milk and diapers program (MAD)  •        Linking client up with Ad hoc donations in cash and kind eg ad hoc festive grocery packs, cash voucher, pass it on items on several occasions in order to further alleviate her financial burden and reduce stress resulting from the family\'s financial situation •        TJ contingency fund previously disbursed to client when husband lost his job and client and family members had health issues, i.e. falling sick frequently There are also other facets and considerations with regard to the family which I am unfortunately unable to go into further detail due the clinical nature of the other counselling issues.However, thank you very much for taking the time to read these updates and history of all our ongoing intervention efforts. I hope that it would give us a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of the complex nature of the case, as well as the ongoing stressors and needs of Norhayati and the family. Moving forward, I am looking forward to the continued partnership and support of all our valued partners as there are several complex needs and issues faced by the family which require all our joint collaborative efforts in order to manage and work through effectively.Please feel free to contact me should you require more information or details about the case or ongoing intervention.Have a great day ahead.','26-08-2020','AD3FF76D-26B8-0544-A4D0-72EF04830FB3','2CA58A82-BD3F-BC4E-8083-F832F6EE7C5D','Rasyidah'),('I would like to provide some key considerations in lieu of our holistic assessment of the family’s history, complex issues and ongoing collaborative interventions:1.         In spite of all the aforementioned issues/risks and concerns we have which are existing in the family, it is assessed that Norhayati and husband are committed in working on these issues in order that the children\'s needs are adequately cared for and achieved. We have seen improvements in their efforts and willingness to work on various action plans and pertinent concerns and there has also been stabilization and reduction in some of the risks and concerns of the family\'s issues through our ongoing collaborative interventions.2.        Other than the irregular attendance issue of Norhayati\'s 3 pre school children still being a key concern, the other safety, well being and home environment safety concerns have been addressed with the family ever since the case conference with My First Skool in March 2020. During regular check ins with Norhayati, there have been no subsequent reports of harsh punishment/inappropriate discipline towards the children. With regard to ascertaining the above, I was able to have a phone session with Norhayati this evening. During the session, Norhayati verbalised and expressed some of her frustrations and appeared to be puzzled as well with regard to a revisit and highlighting of safety concerns and well being of the children when it was already addressed after the case conference in March 2020.  I was able to process and attend to her concerns accordingly and also informed her that we are just concerned and checking in on the overall well being and safety of the children. During previous sessions, as well as the session this evening, she reported that her husband and her have not been using harsh punishment or inappropriate discipline on the children and have been trying some of the alternative discipline and effective parenting approaches as discussed during counselling sessions. To provide some clarification, with regard to the children loitering outside unsupervised, Norhayati verbalized and reported that the children have not been loitering outside ever since covid 19 hit. 3.        During the phone session this evening, Norhayati also expressed and verbalized that she felt relatively overwhelmed and \'pressured\' by the pre school with regard to their eventual decision to place Irman in Jurong Primary School.  Norhayati expressed that she felt puzzled about the pre school responses and comments about her and husband\'s decision about selecting Jurong Primary School for Irman. Norhayati mentioned that this discussion with the pre school took place during the last week of the P1 registration excercise. I processed and explored further with her about this issue and according to norhayati, they decided to select Jurong Primary School for Irman as they did not want Nizam\'s history of irregular attendance to negatively impact Irman in any way. She talked about wanting to have a \'fresh start\' for Irman, even though the school would be logistically further away from her house.( could I request My first skool to clarify and provide your input on this issue that client had given feedback on?)4.        There have been small steps in the right direction and positive signs of progress through effective and close partnership with Lakeside Primary School in light of Nizam\'s school attendance issues. We have recently received updates from the school that Nizam\'s attendance have been improving and he is also showing signs of being receptive to ESU program at Lakeside Family Services. Truly appreciate the hard work of our valued partners at Lakeside Primary and Lakeside Family Services for working closely with us to support the family and it is encouraging to see small steps of stabilization and progress. I am hoping that this would eventually transit to more stable and second order change in Norhayati and her children as well.5.        Norhayati and the family is currently at a stage in which the family is starting to show some small but positive improvements, stabilization and progress. Although there is always a tendency that she would go \'backwards\' or \'stuck\' with regard to the various aforementioned issues, it would be helpful to understand the many complex needs and concerns that the family presents and to give them ample support without coming across as intrusive, space, empathy and understanding. It is in my assessment from my work with client and family thus far that this would be greatly beneficial in assisting them to overcome the many challenges that exist and to move the case forward in the right direction.  I hope the above information and assessment is helpful in understanding the current stage and updates on the case management of the family. Thank you for your partnership to support the family.','26-08-2020','13B5BE1C-0F4E-8846-8DE8-B2E3CC37EF13','2CA58A82-BD3F-BC4E-8083-F832F6EE7C5D','Rasyidah'),('Dear James and all,A quick observation/question -  if Irman like his younger siblings have been having attendance issues at MFS, which is a short distance from their home, is it not likely that putting him in Jurong Primary will be even more of a problem? He has development delays that will also be intertwined with poor attendance, each reinforcing the other. The parents are not coping with sending the kids to one primary school (Lakeside) but would appear to think two primary schools is better.

She stated that with regard to my concern of logistical arrangement and the extended distance factor, she would most likely consider take the option of approaching the school bus vendor for transport arrangement. In lieu of this, I highlighted to Norhayati that this may result in increased expenses and financial burden for the family but Norhayati verbalised that she will try to manage and streamline her expenses and budget more effectively and also expressed that her husband should be able to secure a full time job by then (as he is currently actively seeking employment) ,and this would assist her in coping with the additional expenses. Moving forward, I also do foresee that there might be additional challenges for the family with regard to this decision. I would stipulate that we would then have to be geared up and ready to support them as best as we can in order to alleviate any additional pertinent concerns or burdens which may arise due to their decision of the primary school. I am heartened that we are all in close partnership to assist and support the family through these challenges.Thank you and have a pleasant day ahead.

We went on a YRCP house visit today and came across a resident by the name of Jayabalan. He was a first time drug offender and came out recently in June this year. Prior to his downward spiral earlier this year that\'s triggered by a diagnosis of a health condition, he has had many years of work experience as an equipment maintenance engineer - in fact, all the way from 2003. He told us himself that he was not the kind to job hop. We met his older sister who told us that he has always been the breadwinner and role model in the family that all the relatives look up to. She was also unsure what caused him to go into that but she will always support him. From our interactions with him, both me and my community facilitator observed that he is a really sincere person, and someone who recognizes that having a job would really allow him not to be a burden to his sister and also regain a sense of stability in terms of his mental health. He tells us that being cooped in the house for too long will result in him spiraling. We asked about his former employer, Celestica Electronics, and he told us that he is trying not to go back to them when he is on tagging because he knows the senior management and doesn\'t want them to know. His tagging would end only in March 2021. He has applied and worked for 3M for 2 months after his release but had to leave because the position was night shift (7pm to 7am) and he realized that his body couldn\'t take it. I am attaching his CV below. If you come across any companies that would need production/equipment maintenance people, we\'d be grateful if you could float his CV up to them to get him an interview. Mr and Mrs T, if you happen to know anyone who could link Jayabalan up with an opportunity, do let me know as well. Thank you Mr Gopal for your time.

Child Protective Service (CPS) brought the case to Youth Court and obtained a Care and Protection Order for Sakinah. The safety concerns are family violence (FV) amongst Mdm Alizah, Mdm Nuraslinda and Mr Azman as well as substance abuse by both parents, Mr Azman and Mdm Haslinda. Professionals shared that the triggers for FV are often over parenting, financial issues as well as disagreements over the parenting of Sakinah, especially when Mdm Haslinda and Mr Azman sought ad hoc shelter at Mdm Alizah’s flat. Mdm Haslinda and Mr Azman do not have stable housing at the moment. While Sakinah was not very verbal about her fears/worries possibly due to her learning deficit, Sakinah had shown apparent signs of being affected by the FV issues at home and strained relationship between the adults. Sakinah has shared with her foster parents that she was afraid to go back to Mdm Alizah’s house and wanted to remain in the care of her foster parents. However, during her supervised access with Ms Alizah, Sakinah had a tendency to pander to her caregiver’s wishes and would indicate that she wanted to return to the care of her grandmother.Professionals working with this family had tried to preserve Sakinah’s placement with Mdm Alizah as much as possible before the critical incident occurred. While issues such as stable housing would need to be looked into, the decision to reunify Sakinah with her parents would be largely dependent on the progress demonstrated by the family in addressing the issues of FV/substance abuse – and these would not necessarily be issues that are resolved in the shorter-term. In the meantime, CPS will ensure that Sakinah’s developmental and learning needs are looked into while she is placed under foster care. School Attendance Issues in Other Childreni) HumairahWhile Humairah was noted not to be schooling previously, FST was informed by Mdm Alizah that Humairah will be starting school at Assumption Pathway School (APS) next year. They have bought new uniforms for her and Humairah has expressed her desire to return to school. Mdm Alizah had shared that Humairah had stopped schooling this year as, during the circuit-breaker period, she did not have laptop or phone. As a result, she was not aware of the school schedule and hence, gradually lost touch with the school. Clara from FST will be assisting Mdm Alizah with contacting APS to confirm the plan for Humairah to resume school next year. ii) DanialWhile Danial lives in a separate household, he has a tendency to prefer staying in Mdm Alizah’s house due to her permissive parenting. Danial has been noted to enjoy his freedom, which is something he is unable to get when he lives with his father, who is relatively more strict. Danial was also previously noted to have gone missing for a period of time had during which he stayed with his girlfriend. As a result of the lack of structure provided to Danial, his school attendance has been poor. Thus far, Danial’s school has been trying to work with him through the father to get him to attend school. A referral has recently been made by Danial’s school to an FSC (Skylar/Clara – could you help specify which FSC family was referred to pls?) to follow up on Danial’s school issues and to assist his father with his parenting. Difficulties Working with FamilyAgencies have expressed difficulty working with the family as they are difficult to contact and have a tendency to be non-responsive or be missing. This includes working together with Mr Azman on his shelter arrangement. FST notes that there is a repetitive cycle in which Mdm Nuraslinda and Mr Azman would leave Mdm Alizah’s household due to strained relations, but are unable to sustain living by themselves due to poor employment. They would then return to Mdm Alizah’s house, whereupon another incident of FV would be triggered within a few months due to strained relations. Next Steps1. CPS and FST will continue working with family to address the concerns of Sakinah’s safety as well as the ongoing cycle of FV in the household.2. SSO(RST) will work with FST on surfacing an appeal for rental housing for Mdm Nuraslinda and Mr Azman.3. Tasek Jurong will try to ramp up engagement with Mr Azman through their employment programme and leverage his strengths to take up employment and improve his stability.4. While it would be difficult for Tasek Jurong to engage Danial as there is no relationship or trust established, Tasek will engage Humariah to try to ensure she continues attending school next year','14-10-2020','F0664696-2393-F440-83C7-6FB24FB10EFD','744B8283-1300-0940-9D25-4851266DC638','David Siow'),('','23-09-2020','341C55D0-3567-4040-8625-DA86C8207E7E','744B8283-1300-0940-9D25-4851266DC638','David Siow'),('MPS volunteer,Cheong Heng Chan assessment.Please see attachment.','23-09-2020','C10E7F92-D93E-0741-8286-3B6BA4539B06','744B8283-1300-0940-9D25-4851266DC638','David Siow'),('MPS volunteer,Cheong Heng Chan further update to Mr & Mrs T.Please see attachment.','09-10-2020','1126A607-C21D-C643-B13A-D3F3AF741645','744B8283-1300-0940-9D25-4851266DC638','David Siow'),('Zul claimed that he was working Agape Logistics Pte Ltd as a mover.Informations collected that he was pushing \"drugs\" but what kind of drugs, it  has yet to be identified.

Mr Rajidin is feeling stressed staying at Bible House due to the curfew set in place. He expresses that he is only able to enter the premise at 10.30pm even on the weekends. This has taken a toll on him and he has been experiencing headaches as he is not able to rest after his work, which may end as early as 4.00pm.
